    Hey I'm Jay! My full name is Jayden but I don't use it much. I'm 19 years old and born and raised in Memphis,TN  
    I graduated from Germantown High School in 2021, and started going to Tennessee State, where I ended up going for just a year.
    Now I'm in Code School with Code Crew and having a great time!<br>
